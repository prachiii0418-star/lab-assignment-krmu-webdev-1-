Prachi Manwal Portfolio
This is my first personal portfolio website made using HTML. I made this to show my projects, skills, and to have a place where people can contact me.

I’m a first-year B.Tech student and I’m just starting to explore web development, Python, CSS, and vibe coding. I built this project while learning and experimenting with coding.

Note: Make sure to add a image.png file in the project folder for the profile picture. Otherwise, the profile image will not display on the webpage.
